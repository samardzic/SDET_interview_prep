## SDET_interview_prep

### General:
- What's your ideal work environment?
- Most what skill is essential for testing
- What's one challenge you had to overcome during an automated testing cycle? How did you approach this?
- How do you chose which tests to automate
- How do you account for high-priority, high-severity software bugs?
- describe the differences between quality assurance and quality control
- configuration management?
- Reporting a bug:
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Jira, repetability, priority, severity, label, envinronment, version, images, videos, debug data, xar, logs
- How do you manage the balance between manual and automated testing:
    - Manual tests for exploring new features and functionalities
    - automation is ideal for repetitive tasks, regression tests, load testing, and scenarios requiring multiple data sets. 
    It ensures accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
    - use a risk-based approach to decide what should be automated versus manually tested. 
    This strategy helps optimize both time and resources while ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
- describe a situation where you had to use a creative solution to overcome a testing challenge
- Collaboration with developers, product owners, and other stakeholders is key. By understanding their perspectives, I can create more effective test cases and scenarios.
- What is the role of an SDET in the software development life cycle
    - SDET plays a critical role in the software development life cycle. 
    They bridge the gap between development and testing, ensuring high-quality software production.
- encouraging continuous integration and frequent iterations. This proactive approach helps detect 
defects early and reduces the cost and time of fixing them. 
- Overall, an SDET ensures that the final product is robust, reliable, and meets user expectations.‚Äù
